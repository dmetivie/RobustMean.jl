# RobustMean

This package aim is to implement in Julia some (one-dimensional for now) robust mean estimators.
See [Mean Estimation and Regression Under Heavy-Tailed Distributions: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04280.pdf) for a recent (but already kind of old since the field is very active) survey.

## What is it about?

Computing the empirical mean over a data set is one of the most common operations in data analysis.
